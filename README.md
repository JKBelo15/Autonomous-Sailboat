# Autonomous-Sailboat
---------------------
---------------------

This is a project back in 2019 when I part-time in prototyping in my first OJT company.

An Autonomous Sailboat that uses Magnetometer, Accelerometer, and Gyroscope for Compass Compensation. Also equipped with a wind vane, 3D printed and equipped with Magnets and Hall Effect sensors, to determine wind direction for Sail Adjustment.

The project is intended for an autonomous sailboat that can cross seas for small payload delivery, remote ocean surface research and exploration, and most importantly for fun.

Thank you very Much, Circuit-Help, specially Engr. Gilbert Cacho for helping with the Remote Control Programming and overseeing the project.
